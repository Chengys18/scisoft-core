Run this test manually to sanity check plotting in a running SDA when this 
script is launched from the host Eclipse Dev.
If launched as jython, will use RMI to access plotserver
If launched as python, will use AnalysisRpc to access plotserver, via SDAPlotter

# Note: manual add of path is needed when this is run as an automated test by:
# AutomatedManualPlottingPluginTest.java
