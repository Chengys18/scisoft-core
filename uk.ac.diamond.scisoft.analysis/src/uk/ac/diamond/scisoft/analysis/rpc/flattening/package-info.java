/**
 * This package contains the "flatteners" that are used as part of AnalysisRpc to flatten/unflatten data types before
 * passing them to the XML-RPC transport layer.
 * <p>
 * Most clients will want to deal with AnalysisRpc* classes directly and let them instantiate and use the flatteners as
 * needed. The only exception is the special wrapper classes that allow specific functionality to be performed that
 * cannot be easily represented without wrapping simpler data types. At the time of writing, these are the classes, see
 * their javadocs for more info:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link uk.ac.diamond.scisoft.analysis.rpc.flattening.AbstractDatasetDescriptor}</li>
 * <li> {@link uk.ac.diamond.scisoft.analysis.rpc.flattening.TypedNone}</li>
 * </ul>
