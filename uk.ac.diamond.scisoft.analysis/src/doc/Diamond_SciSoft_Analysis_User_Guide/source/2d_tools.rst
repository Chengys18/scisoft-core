Image Plotting Tools
====================

The image plotting tools appear automatically when an image (two-dimensional data array) is plotted. 
You can choose an image tool by going to the tool action menu, .. image:: images/plot-tool-2d.png , 
and choosing the kind of tool you would like. The follow section details with what each of the tools do.
